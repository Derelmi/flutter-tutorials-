# test2

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

*Add a button.
*Understanding the whole interface.
*Make the App Prettier
*Extract a widget
*Adding a Card
*Theme and Style;
    First, the code requests the app's current theme with Theme.of(context).
    Then, the code defines the card's color to be the same as the theme's colorScheme property. The color scheme contains many colors, and primary is the most prominent, defining color of the app.
You can change this color, and the color scheme of the whole app, by scrolling up to MyApp and changing the seed color for the ColorScheme there; Colors.green, Colours.'then the color you prefer'.
    TextTheme;

*Center the UI
*Adding Functionality
    added a new property to MyAppState called favorites. This property is initialized with an empty list: [].
Specifying the list of words that be contained be a word pair.
    We also added a new method,toggleFavorite(),which either removes or adds the wordpair from the favorite list
*Adding navigation rail
